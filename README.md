# Indy - Internet Direct - Proposed Update

THIS REPO IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED. This repo has been replaced by https://github.com/MWASoftware/IndySecOpenSSL.

IndySecOpenSSL provides a new (optional) OpenSSL package separate from Indy's 
"protocols" package and adds support for OpenSSL 3.0 and later. It may be used
as an add-on the Indy 10.6 or the forthcoming Indy 10.7 releases.

---

Indy.ProposedUpdate was a proposed update to Indy adding support for OpenSSL 3.x. See Readme.OpenSSL for more information.

Branch Status:
* main (this branch) is the current published version. All other branches have archive status.
* OpenSSLAugust2025Update freezes the code at the point that the IdSSLOpenSSL unit split occurred.
* OpenSSLFinal is the final version before the IdSSLOpenSSL unit split occurred.

##August 2025 Update

The objective of this update is to improve readability and maintainability with only minimal impact on the end user. Primarily, this involves splitting up the IdSSLOpenSSL unit with limited code clean up. IdSSLOpenSSL is retained and continues to provide the classes TIdSSLIOHandlerSocketOpenSSL and TIdServerIOHandlerSSLOpenSSL. This should ensure that basic users of Indy OpenSSL should need to do no more than recompile their source code in order to use this update.

For more information see README.IdSSLOpenSSL.Split

##About Indy
